# professional-portfolio

## introduction

This professional portfolio was a project to display what I learned through the couple of weeks of reviewing HTML and CSS. We were to devlop HTML code from scratch based on our learning of style, scrolling, images, etc. 

## challenges

This project deemed challenging as it was my first time writing code from scratch. The skeleton of the the HTML code was fairly easy but remembering the details within CSS (both inline and external) was a bit difficult. In addition, styling with width/font size/height was also very time consuming as I felt I needed to familiarize myself more with all the different code that exists.


## learning

In hindsight, I wish i reviewed the code from the semantic refactor challenge sooner- that was a very good basis of what a simple but effective HTML page should look like. Although my page (I believe) meets the acceptance criteria on a very basic level- there were a lot of ways I could have enhanced my page if I spent more quality time reviewing previous code and identifying how to use it to help me on my future projects.
